# TinyCart API

TinyCart API is a simple mini-shop API. It allows you to manage users,
products, and orders. You can create, read, update, and delete users and
products. You can also create orders for a user with a product and a quantity.

The API is organized around REST. It has predictable resource-oriented URLs,
accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses
standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs. It also uses the
OpenAPI standard to describe its API.
